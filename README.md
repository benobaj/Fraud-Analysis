## Projects
### CreditCardFraud_Detection
A project demonstrating how to build a classifier to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It consists of three parts:
1. **Logistic Regression**: Develop a basic logistic regression model from scratch.
2. **Simple Neural Network**: Extend the logistic regression into a deep feed-forward network using TensorFlow's low-level API.
3. **Keras Integration**: Move from TensorFlow's low-level API to Keras for building more complex models.

This project covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to detect credit card fraud. 

### Anomaly_Detection_with_RNN
This project builds a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with PyTorch to detect anomalies in user activities. T
his technique uses unsupervised learning to identify unusual patterns without pre-labeled data. It is useful for scenarios like detecting data theft or online shopping fraud.
