# FraudDetection

Welcome to my Fraud Detection repository! This project showcases my work with machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify fraudulent activities. These projects have been part of my journey to deepen my understanding of data science, and I'm excited to share them with you.

## Projects
### CreditCardFraud_Detection
This project explores credit card fraud detection using machine learning. It comprises three key parts:

1. **Logistic Regression**: I built a logistic regression model from scratch to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. This involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

2. **Simple Neural Network**: Taking the basic logistic regression, I extended it to a simple deep feed-forward network using TensorFlow's low-level API. This step was a great introduction to neural networks and deep learning concepts.

3. **Keras Integration**: I integrated Keras to streamline building and training deep learning models. This helped improve my workflow and allowed me to experiment with more complex architectures.

Throughout this project, I learned to work with imbalanced datasets and applied techniques like oversampling to address class imbalance.

### Anomaly_Detection_with_RNN
In this project, I focused on detecting anomalies in user activities using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with PyTorch. This unsupervised learning approach was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The goal was to create a model that could identify unusual patterns without relying on labeled data.

The insights gained from this project can be applied to a variety of scenarios, such as detecting data theft or monitoring online shopping for fraudulent activities.


This README presents the projects from a personal perspective, highlighting the skills and experiences gained while working on them. It outlines the different components and provides instructions for interacting with the repository, inviting contributions and questions.
